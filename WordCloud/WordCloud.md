You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.

Examples:

"I like cake, I like it so much!" =>

{ 
    i: 2,
    like: 2,
    cake: 1,
    it: 1,
    so: 1,
    much: 1
}

Words are considered the same whether they 
are capitalized or not.
