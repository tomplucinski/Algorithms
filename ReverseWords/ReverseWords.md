##ReverseWords
You are given an integer N, followed by N ines of input (1 <= N <= 100). Each line of 
input contains one or several words separated with single spaces. Each word is a sequence 
of letters of English alphabet containing between 1 and 10 characters, inclusive. The total number 
of words in the input is between 1 and 100, inclusive.

Your task is to reverse the order of words in each line of input, while preserving the words themselves. 
The lines of your output should not have any trailing or leading spaces.
