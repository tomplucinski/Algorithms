Given all three arrays, write a method to check that my service is first-come, first-served. All food should come out in the same order customers requested it.

We'll represent each customer order as a unique integer.

As an example,

  Take Out Orders: [1, 3, 5]
 Dine In Orders: [2, 4, 6]
  Served Orders: [1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3]
  
  would not be first-come, first-served, since order 3 was requested before order 5 but order 5 was served first.
  
  But,
  
   Take Out Orders: [17, 8, 24]
   Dine In Orders: [12, 19, 2]
    Served Orders: [17, 8, 12, 19, 24, 2]
  would be first-come, first-served.
